# End-to-End Data Analytics Project Using (Python + SQL)
## Project Overview
This project involves an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python for data processing and SQL Server for data storage and analysis. The goal is to extract, clean, transform, and analyze sales data to derive meaningful insights.

Steps Involved
### 1. Data Extraction
Download data from Kaggle API.
Extract files from a zip archive.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Read the extracted file using Pandas.
Handle missing values.
Rename columns (convert to lowercase, replace spaces with underscores).
Derive new columns:
Discount = list_price - sale_price
Profit = sale_price - cost_price
Convert order_date from object type to datetime.
Drop unnecessary columns (cost_price, list_price, discount_percent).
### 3. Loading Data into SQL Server
Load the cleaned data into SQL Server using the append option.
Reload the data using the replace option after transformation.
### 4. Data Analysis & Insights
Identify top 10 revenue-generating products.
Find top 5 highest-selling products in each region.
Compare month-over-month sales growth for 2022 and 2023.
Determine which month had the highest sales for each category.
Identify the sub-category with the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022.
